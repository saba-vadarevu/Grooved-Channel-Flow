    "Define as a dictionary:\n",
    "* $ \\alpha, \\beta $  describing the periodicity, and $Re$\n",
    "* K,L,M,N describing the resolution:\n",
    "    - K: No. of temporal frequencies\n",
    "    - L: No. of positive streamwise Fourier modes\n",
    "    - M: No. of positive spanwise Fourier modes\n",
    "    - N: No. of Chebyshev collocation nodes in wall-normal \n",
    "    - The total size of each variable would be (2L+1)(2M+1)N\n",

    "    - Boundary conditions on $u_0$\n",
    "    - dPdx\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Values\n",
    "* The classes are a subclass of np.ndarray. So the values of the flowField can be directly accessed through the name of the instance. But this is not recommended unless one's absolutely sure about what they're doing. Class methods should be used as much as possible, and if doing something with the arrays outside of the methods, the accompanying dictionaries should also be appropriately modified.\n",
    "    - Store only fluctuations\n",
    "    - Define a separate $u_{base}$ based on `isPois` when the base flow is needed. \n",

    "### Methods to be defined\n",
    "* Viewers: \n",
    "    - self.view1d(): 1D array for state\n",
    "    - self.view4d(): 4D array (streamwise, spanwise, variable ID, wall-normal)\n",
    "* Verification:  self.verify()\n",
    "    - Check that the dictionary `flowDict` has all the required parameters\n",
    "    - Check that the parameters are consistent with the size of the np.ndarray\n",
    "    - Check that appropriate modes are complex conjugates\n",
    "* Slicing: self.slice()\n",
    "    - Return only a subset of Fourier modes (centered at (K,L,M) = (0,0,0) )\n",
    "    - Extend the flowField by adding zero modes for higher wavenumbers\n",
    "* Dot product of flow fields: chi1.dot(chi2)\n",
    "    - Defined as $\\int_0^T\\int_\\forall (u_1\\bar{u_2} + v_1 \\bar{v_2} + w_1 \\bar{w_2}) dx dy dz dt$ \n",
    "    - Optional parameter to include the fourth field variable in the integration\n",
    "* Norm: self.norm()\n",
    "    - self.norm() = sqrt( self.dot(self)) \n",
    "* physical: self.physical(fileName)\n",
    "    - Print field on Cartesian coordinates to file\n",
    "    - Set defaults for optional parameters `xsteps,ysteps,zsteps,tsteps` based on number of Fourier and Chebyshev modes in the flowField. Prints fields at different times to different files\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "* Flow descriptors (see above)\n",
    "    - Keep $ \\alpha, \\beta, Re$ as optional parameters, default values being those used in ChannelFlow: (1.14,2.5,400)\n",
    "    * Resolution: L,M,N    \n",
    "* Base flow type (flag):\n",
    "    - Either linear, or quadratic. Assume linear as default. \n",
    "* Read from file- optional (flag):\n",
    "    - Filename, format ('mat', 'npy', 'asc',...)\n",
    "* Noise levels (default to zero):\n",
    "    - Add random noise to the state vector whose norm is that as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests for class\n",
    "* Ensure that solving for flat-walled Couette and Poiseuille flows using direct inversion works\n",
    "* Ensure that the above cases work with iterative solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other notes to self:\n",
    "* Write doc-strings for all the methods and inputs\n",
    "* When initializing flowField as white-noise, think about smoothening the noise. Do this by using random coefficients for fields in Chebyshev spectral, and then transform to collocation nodes. Put more of the energy into lower Cheb modes and lower Fourier modes. \n"
