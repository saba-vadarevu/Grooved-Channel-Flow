#separation does occur, it gives the locations of separation and
#reattachment- hence the extent of the recirculation bubble, and the height
#of the reattachment bubble.

# Separation is identified by looking for the appearance of negative
# streamwise velocities. The x-location of the separation is given by the
# lowest 'x' at which negative streamwise velocity appears, and the
# location of the reattachment given by the highest 'x' at which negative
# streamwise velocity appears. 

# The height of the bubble is a bit more tricky. I take particles at one
# crest of the surface waviness and integrate them towards the next crest.
# All particles that encounter a negative velocity are dropped. Among those
# that remain, the one that goes to the lowest 'y' is used to determine the
# height of the bubble.

    # 'xsres', which gives the size of the largest recirculation zone that can 
    # go uncaptured.

    # search algorithm.

    # there is no separation.

    # 'xl1' always stores the location explored immediately before the current.
    # 'xl2' gives the direction in which the exploration must proceed.
